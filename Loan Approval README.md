# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including features such as gender, marital status, income, credit history, and property area.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan application
- 
- Gender: Gender of the applicant (Male/Female)
- 
- Married: Marital status of the applicant (Yes/No)
- 
- Dependents: Number of dependents
- 
- Education: Applicant's education level (Graduate/Not Graduate)
- 
- Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed (Yes/No)
- 
- ApplicantIncome: Applicant's income
- 
- CoapplicantIncome: Co-applicant's income
- 
- LoanAmount: Loan amount requested
- 
- Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months
- 
- Credit_History: Credit history of the applicant (1: Good, 0: Bad)
- 
- Property_Area: Area where the property is located (Urban/Rural/Semiurban)
- 
- Loan_Status: Loan approval status (Y: Yes, N: No)

## Model Training

1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.
 
2. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
 
3. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data.
   
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Predictions

Use the trained model to predict loan approval for new data. Load the new data, preprocess it, and use the trained model to make predictions.

## Usage Instructions

To run the project:

1. Install the required libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook for loan approval prediction.
